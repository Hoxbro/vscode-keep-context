This extension was created to help those that at some point need to do some context switch and some times more often than we would like.
With this extension you won't forget the files that you need to open to continue working in that task.

## Features

### Task management

In a simple way you can:
- Create/edit/delete task
- Track opened files by task
- Track git branch by task

## Keybindings

- `Ctrl+K Ctrl+Shift+C` (`Cmd` instead of `Ctrl` for MacOS) to create a task.

## Limitations

- It may work in workspaces with more than one folder, but it only supports single folders.

## Known Issues

We are just starting but we know that we will have issues, to avoid duplicated issues they will be here :beetle:
